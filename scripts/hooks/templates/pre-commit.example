# An example hook script to verify what is about to be committed.
# Called by "git commit" with no arguments.  The hook should
# exit with non-zero status after issuing an appropriate message if
# it wants to stop the commit.
#
# To enable this hook, rename this file to "pre-commit".
#
# Sample usage would be:
# 1. running formatter and linter, such as gofmt and goimports
# 2. adding additional team rules
